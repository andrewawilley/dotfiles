# Quickstart
This is a quick way to get up and running on a new Mac.  Pull directly to the user home folder, update the Brewfile with additional packages and comment out the formulae/casks you don't want.  Grant execute permission with `chmod -x config.sh` and then run with `./config.sh`

# TODO 
 * Finish testing all of the MacOS default updates
